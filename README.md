# SBD-RTRM: Sparse blind deconvolution using the Riemannian Trust-Region Method (RTRM)

**SBD-RTRM** is a MATLAB package for *sparse blind deconvolution* (SBD) using the *Riemannian Trust Region* method (RTRM). As sparse blind deconvolution is a nonconvex problem, using RTRM ensures that local minima will be found in the associated optimization objective.

Our package is motivated by studies in blind deconvolution as a nonconvex optimization problem, and by applications in Scanning Tunneling Microscopy.
